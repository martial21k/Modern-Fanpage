            Throughout his expansive career as a successful DJ, producer, remixer, label boss, filmmaker, and philanthropist, former 2 x World No.1 DJ, Hardwell has carved out a long-lasting legacy within the electronic music world.

            Hailing proudly from Breda, a city tucked deep within the Netherlands, Hardwell's journey began at 14, becoming a much sought-after artist on the Dutch dance scene before international attention began to pour in. Fast forward some ten years, and Hardwell, aged 25, capped off a perennial journey when he was first crowned World's #1 DJ in 2013. Already on his way to helping shape the EDM explosion at that time, Hardwell emerged as one of the most acclaimed stars of the modern era of electronic music.
            
            His appeal as a producer would catapult his status amongst fans and peers. Hardwell would earn countless Beatport No. 1's with releases like 'Spaceman', 'Apollo' and 'Run Wild' through his dancefloor singles. Whilst remixing for many of pop music's biggest names, including Rihanna, Calvin Harris, Moby, U2, J Balvin and Coldplay. At the same time, delivering crossover hit singles working alongside major acts like Craig David, Jay Sean, Austin Mahone, and Jason Derulo. And never straying too far from his electronic roots, Hardwell would collaborate with DJ friends like Armin van Buuren, Dimitri Vegas & Like Mike, Steve Aoki, Afrojack, and Tiësto.
            
            His acclaimed 2015 album 'United We Are' proved to be a ground-breaking moment for Hardwell. A rich and diverse debut release, the album would secure the #2 position in the iTunes worldwide album chart.
            
            As well as the hits, Hardwell's presence as a headline attraction on the biggest main stages in music placed him on every significant festival that included Lollapalooza, Coachella, EDC Las Vegas, Creamfields, Untold Festival, EXIT festival, Ultra Music Festival and Tomorrowland. His draw on the stadium and arena circuit saw Hardwell complete two world tours with 'I Am Hardwell' in 2014/15 and then 'I Am Hardwell - United We Are' in 2015/16. Concluding in 62 shows across 21 countries with 897,617 fans in attendance. Official documentaries supported the culmination of both tours highlighting Hardwell's career journey and life on the road with sold-out shows at venues like London's Brixton Academy and New York's Madison Square Garden.
            
            Always eager to push the boundaries of his performance environment, Hardwell's continually sought new platforms to share his music with the world. These have included one-off shows at events like the UEFA Champions League Final to being the first DJ to perform a solo event at Germany's world-renowned Hockenheim circuit. And the first DJ to play on the podium at Formula 1 when he dazzled music and sports fans alike at the Mexican Grand Prix. 
            
            Along the way, Hardwell's maintained a deep-rooted connection to the club scene. From headline shows at Ministry of Sound in the UK to Green Valley in Brazil, Hardwell's also held residencies at Hakkasan Las Vegas, Ushuaia Ibiza and Macau based Club Cubic, making him the first DJ from the west to have a residency there.
            
            With an established and solid online presence, Hardwell is one of the most ‘clicked on' artists in the electronic scene with over 8.6 million Facebook followers, 7.2 million Twitter followers, 4.8 million Instagram followers and more than 1.1 billion hits on his YouTube channel. In addition, Hardwell has long been a pioneering figure in the live streaming landscape in a career littered with record-breaking streams at some of the world's biggest events. His 2012 Tomorrowland set famously crashed the festival's live stream server and currently sits at 25 million views on YouTube. His 2013 stream for Ultra Music Festival clocks in at over 34 million views on YouTube. His 2018 performance at Ultra would achieve a staggering 1.6 million views in less than two weeks and prove a standout moment for his fans.
            
            From winning prestigious awards such as an MTV European Music Award and multiple International Dance Music Awards, the seasoned international star has become one of dance music's most decorated artists with a cabinet of awards ranging from 2 x World #1 DJ titles to being awarded a 'Best Electro House DJ' at the DJ Awards in Ibiza, 'Best Global DJ' at the IDMA awards and 'Best DJ' at the Nova Era Awards.
            
            Alongside his artistic endeavours, Hardwell also sought to utilise his position for philanthropic causes. With his United We Are Foundation, the project achieved social change through two aid events labelled the 'World's Biggest Guestlist'. These special aid concerts hosted at Mumbai's DY Patil Stadium in December 2015 and 2017 would raise enough donations to school a combined 122,000 children from the slums of Mumbai. Over the two aid concerts, more than 145,000 attended, and over 20 million people watched via the live streams on the night.
            
            In Autumn 2018, after more than a decade of playing the most significant stages on the planet, Hardwell announced he would be taking a sabbatical from touring. However, before temporarily stepping out of the limelight, the seasoned veteran gave his fans one final show to celebrate with him. Hardwell performed a special one-off concert at the Ziggo Dome during Amsterdam Dance Event, collaborating live with Metropole Orkest Symphony. Merging the worlds of pop, jazz, and electronic, Hardwell took the audience on an explorative trip of dance music history.
            
            Although out of the spotlight of touring, Hardwell's creative output continued to flow. Studio singles kept coming for the remainder of 2018 and throughout 2019. In addition, the start of 2020 saw the release of The Story of Hardwell, a unique collective album of his most significant past and present hits.
            
            Time away from touring would allow Hardwell to be more hands-on with his award-winning label, Revealed Recordings, to reorganise and expand the longstanding imprint. This period away from touring also meant he could commit more focus in the studio for artist discovery. During this interval, the fruits of his action resulted in a body of work that would signify a new era in the Hardwell story.
            
            On March 27th, 2022, after 3.5 years away, Hardwell returned to Miami's Ultra Music Festival to perform a surprise closing set. Armed with a new 14 track artist album, Rebels Never Die, released on Revealed Recordings and the announcement of a massive world tour, Hardwell ignited the attention of fans around the globe. Always a leader, with a quest to evolve, not repeat. Rebels Neve Die represents a critical point in the musical shift for one of electronic music's biggest known stars.
